Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
================================

In addition to standard tile-based neural networks, Slideflow also supports training multiple-instance learning (MIL) models. Several architectures are available, including `attention-based MIL <https://github.com/AMLab-Amsterdam/AttentionDeepMIL>`_ (``"Attention_MIL"``), `CLAM <https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM>`_ (``"CLAM_SB",`` ``"CLAM_MB"``, ``"MIL_fc"``, ``"MIL_fc_mc"``), and `transformer MIL <https://github.com/szc19990412/TransMIL>`_ (``"TransMIL"``). Custom architectures can also be trained. MIL training requires PyTorch.

Generating features
*******************

The first step in MIL model development is generating features from image tiles. Many types of feature extractors can be used, including imagenet-pretrained models, models finetuned in Slideflow, histology-specific pretrained feature extractors (such as CTransPath or RetCCL), or fine-tuned SSL models.  In all cases, feature extractors are built with :func:`slideflow.model.build_feature_extractor`, and features are generated for a dataset using either with :ref:`slideflow.DatasetFeatures.to_torch() <activations>` or :meth:`slideflow.Project.generate_feature_bags`.

ImageNet Features
-----------------

To calculate features from an ImageNet-pretrained network, first build an imagenet feature extractor with :func:`slideflow.model.build_feature_extractor`. The first argument should be the name of an architecture followed by ``_imagenet``, and the expected tile size should be passed to the keyword argument ``tile_px``. You can optionally specify the layer from which to generate features with the ``layers`` argument; if not provided, it will default to calculating features from post-convolutional layer activations. For example, to build a ResNet50 feature extractor for images at 299 x 299 pixels:

.. code-block:: python

    from slideflow.model import build_feature_extractor

    resnet50 = build_feature_extractor(
        'resnet50_imagenet',
        tile_px=299
    )

This will calculate features using activations from the post-convolutional layer. You can also concatenate activations from multiple neural network layers and apply pooling for layers with 2D output shapes.

.. code-block:: python

    from slideflow.model import build_feature_extractor

    resnet50 = build_feature_extractor(
        'resnet50_imagenet',
        layers=['conv1_relu', 'conv3_block1_2_relu'],
        pooling='avg',
        tile_px=299
    )

If a model architecture is available in both the Tensorflow and PyTorch backends, Slideflow will default to using the active backend. You can manually set the feature extractor backend using `backend`.

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a PyTorch feature extractor
    extractor = build_feature_extractor(
        'resnet50_imagenet',
        layers=['layer2.0.conv1', 'layer3.1.conv2'],
        pooling='avg',
        tile_px=299,
        backend='torch'
    )

You can view all available feature extractors with :func:`slideflow.model.list_extractors`.

Features from Finetuned Model
-----------------------------

You can also calculate features from any model trained in Slideflow. The first argument to ``build_feature_extractor()`` should be the path of the trained model.  You can optionally specify the layer at which to calculate activations using the ``layers`` keyword argument. If not specified, activations are calculated at the post-convolutional layer.

.. code-block:: python

    from slideflow.model import build_feature_extractor

    # Calculate features from trained model.
    features = build_feature_extractor(
        '/path/to/model',
        layers='sepconv3_bn'
    )

Pretrained Feature Extractor
----------------------------

Slideflow includes two pathology-specific pretrained feature extractors, RetCCL and CTransPath. Use :func:`slideflow.model.build_feature_extractor` to build one of these feature extractors by name. Weights for these pretrained networks will be automatically downloaded from `HuggingFace <https://github.com/jamesdolezal/slideflow/blob/untagged-bf8d980a34d2a9ddfde5/huggingface.co/jamesdolezal/retccl>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    from slideflow.model import build_feature_extractor

    retccl = build_feature_extractor('retccl', tile_px=299)

Self-Supervised Learning
------------------------

Finally, you can also generate features from a :ref:`self-supervised learning <simclr_ssl>` model. Use ``'simclr'`` as the first argument to ``build_feature_extractor()``, and pass the path to a saved model (or saved checkpoint file) via the keyword argument ``ckpt``.

.. code-block:: python

    from slideflow.model import build_feature_extractor

    simclr = build_feature_extractor(
        'simclr',
        ckpt='/path/to/simclr.ckpt'
    )

Exporting Features
------------------

Once you have prepared a feature extractor, features can be generated for a dataset and exported to disk for later use. Pass a feature extractor to the first argument of :meth:`slideflow.Project.generate_feature_bags`, with a :class:`slideflow.Dataset` as the second argument.

.. code-block:: python

    # Load a project and dataset.
    P = sf.Project(...)
    dataset = P.dataset(tile_px=299, tile_um=302)

    # Create a feature extractor.
    retccl = build_feature_extractor('retccl', tile_px=299)

    # Calculate & export feature bags.
    P.generate_feature_bags(retccl, dataset)

.. note::

    If you are generating features from a SimCLR model trained with stain normalization,
    you should specify the stain normalizer using the ``normalizer`` argument to :meth:`slideflow.Project.generate_feature_bags` or :class:`slideflow.DatasetFeatures`.

Features are calculated for slides in batches, keeping memory usage low. By default, features are saved to disk in a directory named ``pt_files`` within the project directory, but you can override the destination directory using the ``outdir`` argument.

Alternatively, you can calculate features for a dataset using :class:`slideflow.DatasetFeatures` and the ``.to_torch()`` method.  This will calculate features for your entire dataset at once, which may require a large amount of memory. The first argument should be the feature extractor, and the second argument should be a :class:`slideflow.Dataset`.

.. code-block:: python

    # Calculate features for the entire dataset.
    features = sf.DatasetFeatures(retccl, dataset)

    # Export feature bags.
    features.to_torch('/path/to/bag_directory/')


.. warning::

    Using :class:`slideflow.DatasetFeatures` directly may result in a large amount of memory usage, particularly for sizable datasets. When generating feature bags for training MIL models, it is recommended to use :meth:`slideflow.Project.generate_feature_bags` instead.

When image features are exported for a dataset, the feature extractor configuration is saved to ``bags_config.json`` in the same directory as the exported features. This configuration file can be used to rebuild the feature extractor. An example file is shown below.

.. code-block:: json

    {
     "extractor": {
      "class": "slideflow.model.extractors.retccl.RetCCLFeatures",
      "kwargs": {
       "center_crop": true
      }
     },
     "normalizer": {
      "method": "macenko",
      "fit": {
       "stain_matrix_target": [
        [
         0.5062568187713623,
         0.22186939418315887
        ],
        [
         0.7532230615615845,
         0.8652154803276062
        ],
        [
         0.4069173336029053,
         0.42241501808166504
        ]
       ],
       "target_concentrations": [
        1.7656903266906738,
        1.2797492742538452
       ]
      }
     },
     "num_features": 2048,
     "tile_px": 299,
     "tile_um": 302
    }

The feature extractor can be manually rebuilt using :func:`slideflow.model.rebuild_extractor()`:

.. code-block:: python

    from slideflow.model import rebuild_extractor

    # Recreate the feature extractor
    # and stain normalizer, if applicable
    extractor, normalizer = rebuild_extractor('/path/to/bags_config.json')


Training
********

Model Configuration
-------------------

To train an MIL model on exported features, first prepare an MIL configuration using :func:`slideflow.mil.mil_config`.

The first argument to this function is the model architecture (which can be a name or a custom ``torch.nn.Module`` model), and the remaining arguments are used to configure the training process (including learning rate and epochs).

By default, training is executed using `FastAI <https://docs.fast.ai/>`_ with `1cycle learning rate scheduling <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09820.pdf%E5%92%8CSylvain>`_. Available models out-of-the-box include `attention-based MIL <https://github.com/AMLab-Amsterdam/AttentionDeepMIL>`_ (``"Attention_MIL"``), `CLAM <https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM>`_ (``"CLAM_SB",`` ``"CLAM_MB"``, ``"MIL_fc"``, ``"MIL_fc_mc"``), and `transformer MIL <https://github.com/szc19990412/TransMIL>`_ (``"TransMIL"``).

.. code-block:: python

    import slideflow as sf
    from slideflow.mil import mil_config

    config = mil_config('attention_mil', lr=1e-3)

Custom MIL models can also be trained with this API. Import a custom MIL model as a PyTorch module, and pass this as the first argument to :func:`slideflow.mil.mil_config`.

.. code-block:: python

    import slideflow as sf
    from slideflow.mil import mil_config
    from my_module import CustomMIL

    config = mil_config(CustomMIL, lr=1e-3)


Legacy CLAM Trainer
-------------------

In addition to the FastAI trainer, CLAM models can be trained using the `original <https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM>`_ CLAM training loop. This trainer has been modified, cleaned, and included as a submodule in Slideflow. This legacy trainer can be used for CLAM models by setting ``trainer='clam'`` for an MIL configuration:

.. code-block:: python

    config = mil_config(..., trainer='clam')


Training an MIL Model
---------------------

Next, prepare a :ref:`training and validation dataset <datasets_and_validation>` and use :func:`slideflow.Project.train_mil` to start training. For example, to train a model using three-fold cross-validation to the outcome "HPV_status":

.. code-block:: python

    ...

    # Prepare a project and dataset
    P = sf.Project(...)
    full_dataset = dataset = P.dataset(tile_px=299, tile_um=302)

    # Split the dataset using three-fold, site-preserved cross-validation
    splits = full_dataset.kfold_split(
        k=3,
        labels='HPV_status',
        preserved_site=True
    )

    # Train on each cross-fold
    for train, val in splits:
        P.train_mil(
            config=config,
            outcomes='HPV_status',
            train_dataset=train,
            val_dataset=val,
            bags='/path/to/bag_directory'
        )

Model training statistics, including validation performance (AUROC, AP) and predictions on the validation dataset, will be saved in an ``mil`` subfolder within the main project directory.

If you are training an attention-based MIL model (``attention_mil``, ``clam_sb``, ``clam_mb``), heatmaps of attention can be generated for each slide in the validation dataset by using the argument ``attention_heatmaps=True``. You can customize these heatmaps with ``interpolation`` and ``cmap`` arguments to control the heatmap interpolation and colormap, respectively.

.. code-block:: python

    # Generate attention heatmaps,
    # using the 'magma' colormap and no interpolation.
    P.train_mil(
        attention_heatmaps=True,
        cmap='magma',
        interpolation=None
    )

Hyperparameters, model configuration, and feature extractor information is logged to ``mil_params.json`` in the model directory. This file also contains information about the input and output shapes of the MIL network and outcome labels. An example file is shown below.

.. code-block:: json

    {
     "trainer": "fastai",
     "params": {

     },
     "outcomes": "histology",
     "outcome_labels": {
      "0": "Adenocarcinoma",
      "1": "Squamous"
     },
     "bags": "/mnt/data/projects/example_project/bags/simclr-263510/",
     "input_shape": 1024,
     "output_shape": 2,
     "bags_encoder": {
      "extractor": {
       "class": "slideflow.model.extractors.simclr.SimCLR_Features",
       "kwargs": {
        "center_crop": false,
        "ckpt": "/mnt/data/projects/example_project/simclr/00001-EXAMPLE/ckpt-263510.ckpt"
       }
      },
      "normalizer": null,
      "num_features": 1024,
      "tile_px": 299,
      "tile_um": 302
     }
    }

Evaluation
**********

To evaluate a saved MIL model on an external dataset, first extract features from a dataset, then use :func:`slideflow.Project.evaluate_mil`:

.. code-block:: python

    import slideflow as sf
    from slideflow.model import build_feature_extractor

    # Prepare a project and dataset
    P = sf.Project(...)
    dataset = P.dataset(tile_px=299, tile_um=302)

    # Generate features using CTransPath
    ctranspath = build_feature_extractor('ctranspath', tile_px=299)
    features = sf.DatasetFeatures(ctranspath, dataset=dataset)
    features.to_torch('/path/to/bag_directory')

    # Evaluate a saved MIL model
    P.evaluate_mil(
        '/path/to/saved_model'
        outcomes='HPV_status',
        dataset=dataset,
        bags='/path/to/bag_directory',
    )

As with training, attention heatmaps can be generated for attention-based MIL models with the argument ``attention_heatmaps=True``, and these can be customized using ``cmap`` and ``interpolation`` arguments.

.. image:: att_heatmap.jpg

Single-Slide Inference
**********************

Predictions can also be generated for individual slides, without requiring the user to manually generate feature bags. Use :func:`slideflow.model.predict_slide` to generate predictions for a single slide. The first argument is th path to the saved MIL model (a directory containing ``mil_params.json``), and the second argument can either be a path to a slide or a loaded :class:`sf.WSI` object.

.. code-block:: python

    from slideflow.mil import predict_slide
    from slideflow.slide import qc

    # Load a slide and apply Otsu thresholding
    slide = '/path/to/slide.svs'
    wsi = sf.WSI(slide, tile_px=299, tile_um=302)
    wsi.qc(qc.Otsu())

    # Calculate predictions and attention heatmap
    model = '/path/to/mil_model'
    y_pred, y_att = predict_slide(model, wsi)


The function will return a tuple of predictions and attention heatmaps. If the model is not attention-based, the attention heatmap will be ``None``. To calculate attention for a model, set ``attention=True``:

.. code-block:: python

    y_pred, y_att = predict_slide(model, slide, attention=True)

The returned attention values will be a masked ``numpy.ndarray`` with the same shape as the slide tile extraction grid. Unused tiles will have masked attention values.


Visualizing Attention Heatmaps
*******************************

Attention heatmaps can be interactively visualized in Slideflow Studio by enabling the Multiple-Instance Learning extension (new in Slideflow 2.1.0). This extension is discussed in more detail in the :ref:`extensions` section.
